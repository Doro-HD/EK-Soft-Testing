### Risk Analysis
You, a group of students from EK, have received a formal request from Copenhagen's EK Ølbar to develop a promotional website. For this reason, you decide to create a software development startup and achieve all tasks (design, coding, testing, documentation, domain registration, server subscription and maintenance). The requirements specification is the following:

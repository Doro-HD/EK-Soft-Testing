### Stress Performance Testing Exercise

Install and run [Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/).

Go to https://jmeter-plugins.org/. Download and install the plugin [Custom Thread Group](https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/ConcurrencyThreadGroup/).

1. Test HTTP requests against a public website like https://landonhotel.com/ as a load test.<br>
   **Use a small or average load.**<br>
   **Do not stress a public website. It will look like a DoS attack**

2. Test a web application of your own. Implement the following:
   - Load testing
   - Stress testing
   - Spike testing
   - Soak testing
To do this, you will need to use the plugin Custom Thread Group, specifically the threads `jp@gc - Ultimate Thread Group` and `bzm - Concurrency Thread Group` (this last one for the stress test):
